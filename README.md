This is a general public chain development template based on [polkadot-sdk](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) and [frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier), using the NPOS protocol and compatible with the Ethereum EVM. It aims to make Polkadot technology more developer-friendly and to be used by more public chain teams.
[polkadot-sdk](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) is an excellent public chain development technology, and we thank the ParityTech team for their contributions.

## develop chain
[start develop](./docs/start-develop.md)

> cargo install --force --locked cargo-contract --version 4.1.1
## Develop and deploy your Solidity contract.

> This template's EVM contract development is 100% the same as Ethereum.

## Deploy your explorer
[https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout)
> Note that currently BlockScout does not support displaying transfer records in the balances module, so you should use MetaMask as much as possible for transfers.

## connect MetaMask wallet
todo 

> To make it easier for users and developers in the Ethereum community to connect to your network node or wallet, you should add your network on [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org/).
