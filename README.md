This is a general public chain development template based on [polkadot-sdk](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) and [frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier), using the NPOS protocol and compatible with the Ethereum EVM. It aims to make Polkadot technology more developer-friendly and to be used by more public chain teams.
[polkadot-sdk](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) is an excellent public chain development technology, and we thank the ParityTech team for their contributions.
